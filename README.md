This is the code for BoTR Team #1130's rover for 2020. 

Server: The server is the Raspberry Pi on board the rover. It will have sensors, a camera, and motors connected to it.

Client: The client is the Raspberry Pi on site. It will have an Xbox controller attached to it via USB. 

Both of the RPis will establish a connection over WiFi. Inputs via the controller will be processed by the client and be sent to the server over the connection.
